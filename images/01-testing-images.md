# Introduction

This chapter is written primarily for newly hired Facilitators,
especially those without prior experience with ACI facilitation and/or
working as part of an ACI team. It is meant to assist new Facilitators
as they start with the task of defining their role. The first section on
<img class="non-captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/bob-teaching.jpg" alt="Bob teaching"/>institutional context views the role of facilitation and the hiring of a
Facilitator through an institutional lens. Subsequent sections are on
understanding and owning the facilitator role, and examining aspects of
the on-boarding process that are specific to ACI facilitation, including
organizational structure, computational resources, the ACI team, the
user base, and current state of facilitation.

Whether the Facilitator is a new hire or is transitioning into the role
from a related position, they will benefit from an understanding of the
considerations that were important to the ACI organization as they made
the decision to hire an ACI Facilitator. For example, was the value of
facilitation known and in demand by the institution, or will it have to
be proven? Does the organization have specific expectations, or must the
role of the Facilitator be progressively defined by the new hire? 
Reflecting on these questions, or asking them directly of the
organization, is a good place to start as a new Facilitator. Even at
institutions where the value of facilitation is unknown, or the role of
the Facilitator is not well-defined, it is essential that there is
support for the concept of facilitation at a number of levels – the
institution, the ACI team, the researcher community – and a commitment
to provide the new Facilitator with the time and resources necessary to
succeed. 

<a name="administration"></a>

## Administrative Expectations 

There may have been multiple
reasons that motivated the institution to establish a Facilitator
position or there may have been a specific driving force, perhaps a
change or planned change in ACI resource availability and/or usage. When
making the decision to hire a Facilitator, the leadership of the ACI
organization would have considered a number of things to ensure success
for all stakeholders. To guide the hiring process and help define the
position, they may have addressed the following questions:


<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>What gaps exist in the expertise of the existing team members?</li>
<li>What are most important tasks/responsibilities of the new position?</li>
<li>What is the required skill set necessary to perform these tasks?</li>
<li>What educational background and experience are important?</li>
<li>Is there specific domain expertise that will be important for this facilitator?</li>
        <ul class="bullet-list-circle">
            <li>secondary list item 1</li>
            <li>secondary list item 2</li>
        </ul>	 
        <li>bullet pt 3</li>          
    </ul> 
</div>


* What gaps exist in the expertise of the existing team members? 
* What are most important tasks/responsibilities of the new position? 
* What is the required skill set necessary to perform these tasks? 
* What educational background and experience are important? 
* Is there specific domain expertise that will be important for this facilitator?


<div style="background-color:#EBF5FB; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding:20px 0; margin-top:30px"> 
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">          
<li>What gaps exist in the expertise of the existing team members?</li>          
<li>What are most important tasks/responsibilities of the new position?</li>	 
<li>What is the required skill set necessary to perform these tasks?</li>          
<li>What educational background and experience are important?</li>	  
<li>Is there specific domain expertise that will be important for this facilitator?</li>
</ul> 
</div>

 
The answers to these questions would have helped prioritize expectations
for the new position and helped guide the hiring process, including how
to reach an appropriate candidate pool.

## ACI Team Expectations 

Having an ACI team endorse the notion of
facilitation is also important to the success of a new Facilitator. The
existence of a supportive working environment, backed by a team that is
open to exploring new ways to enable researchers and is willing to spend
time to assist a new Facilitator in learning about its resources, is a
tremendous asset to a new Facilitator. Therefore it is crucial that the
ACI team be involved in the hiring process.

# Understanding the Facilitator Role

<div class="captioned">

</div>
Once a person has been hired to serve as a Facilitator, a joint effort
between the Facilitator and the hiring manager to start to define the
position is the next step. While some aspects of the position, such as
the overall goals and major activities, may have been defined in the
hiring process, many will still have to be set once the Facilitator has
started. These might include day-to-day practices for carrying out
activities, and modes of working with teammates and reporting to
supervisors. In order to contribute to this dialog, a new Facilitator
should first discover and understand a number of details about both the
institution and their ACI-providing organization, including whether the
ACI organization is already established, or in the process of
establishing a user base for a new resource. Facilitators coming into an
institution with existing resources and an established user base,
whether or not they have had a Facilitator in the past, will have
different priorities than those who were hired to help assist in
building up ACI resources and utilization. 

<a name="user-base"></a>

## User base 

<table>
<tr><td>
![Bob teaching]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/bob-teaching.jpg){:.non-captioned}{:style="float:none;"}
</td></tr>
</table>
It is crucial that a new Facilitator understand the 
existing and prospective user base. A
new Facilitator should identify the major ACI users, the departments and
fields of study that are represented, and identify any special needs.
This information may or may not be readily available in the ACI group’s
systems; if not, efforts to obtain this information should be a
priority. For instance, the ACI group may already be collecting user and
usage statistics, or be able to assist the Facilitator in the collection
of this type of data. In addition, a Facilitator can explore
publications or other reports of research completed using ACI resources
in order to obtain information on the existing user base. While studying
the existing user base, Facilitators should ponder their prospective
users as well. At this point, it is important to begin identifying
avenues and opportunities for reaching out to both current and
prospective users (see *[outreach](../02-outreach)* chapter). 

<a name="existing-resources"></a>

## Existing computational resources 

A new Facilitator should make extensive efforts to understand the ACI
resources for which they have been hired to support, while also
developing an awareness of other related resources available to
researchers, both on campus and elsewhere, whether or not the resources
are currently being utilized. This includes detailed knowledge about
what resources exist and the types of resources directly managed by the
ACI organization, as well as knowing how to use these resources in order
to be able to effectively provide assistance.  Specific knowledge
includes:



<div style="background-color:#EBF5FB; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding:20px 0; margin-top:30px"> 
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">         
<li>Details about the compute hardware</li>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li>what compute resources are available</li>
	<li>what file systems exist </li>
	<li>what is the networking infrastructure </li>
	<li>what operating system(s) are supported</li>
	</ul>
<li>Details on the batch scheduler and batch policies that are being used </li>
<li>What services are provided </li>
<li>Existing policies and procedures for use of the resources</li> 
<li>Tools being used for user provisioning and tracking usage</li>
</ul>
</div>

Use of ACI Resources](../05-assistance)*.

# Owning the Facilitator Role

The Facilitator should work first to establish a presence within the ACI
organization, and then to identify ways to inform the larger ACI
community of the existence and role of the new Facilitator. A first step
is to prepare materials to introduce the Facilitator and enable them to
start to engage with the user base. This might include doing the
following:



<div style="background-color:#EBF5FB; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding:20px 0; margin-top:30px"> 
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">         
<li>requisitioning business cards</li> 
<li>developing an online presence (on the ACI website/social media stream)</li> 
<li>introducing yourself in a newsletter article </li>
<li>giving a presentation to administrators/staff</li> 
<li>giving a seminar to users</li> 
<li>sending an announcement to a mailing lists</li> 
<li>posting an announcement on the institution’s website</li>
</ul>
</div>

Some of these activities may require preparing new materials or
modifying existing ones in collaboration with the ACI team or
communications staff. Once the presence of the new Facilitator has been
established, it is time to begin to engage with the user base.
