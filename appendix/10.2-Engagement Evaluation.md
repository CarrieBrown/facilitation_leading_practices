<h1>Engagement Evaluation </h1>
The Engagement Evaluation is an informal survey/assessment, designed to be used after meetings or engagements with users, but not necessarily after each engagement. There are two pieces to the evaluation below: 

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
   <li>general information, which could mostly be provided by the facilitator</li>
<li>a series of interview questions, which could be administered to the researcher in person or via a survey tool</li> 
</ul>
</div>
Depending on the goal of this evaluation, these pieces can be mixed and matched in order to: 
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
   <li>track specific users and/or projects in a standardized manner</li>
  <li>obtain feedback on facilitation interactions in order to adjust and improve future interaction</li>
  <li>understand the impact of ACI-REF interactions</li>
</ul>
